# 📊 Ghana HIV Data Analysis (2004–2014)
Comprehensive Regional, Gender, Age, Site, and Mortality Insights
This project presents an in-depth analysis of HIV trends in Ghana using five major datasets covering prevalence, gender distribution, regional distribution, age patterns, site-level data, and AIDS-related deaths.
All analyses were visualized through multi-dashboard Power BI reports.

## INTRODUCTION
HIV remains one of the most significant public health challenges in Ghana, affecting individuals, families, and entire communities across the country. Understanding the prevalence and distribution of HIV is essential for guiding national health policies, allocating resources, and implementing targeted interventions.
<p></p>
By analyzing trends across regions, age groups, and years, stakeholders can identify high-risk areas, monitor progress toward national health goals, and strengthen prevention and treatment strategies. This analysis provides valuable insights into how HIV cases are evolving over time, helping health authorities, researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions that support a healthier and more resilient nation.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
HIV continues to pose a significant public health challenge in Ghana, affecting individuals, families, and communities across all regions. Despite ongoing interventions, variations in prevalence still exist between regions, age groups, and genders, making it necessary to conduct detailed and data-driven assessments. Understanding these patterns is essential for guiding national strategies, improving resource allocation, and strengthening prevention and treatment programs.
However, existing HIV-related data in Ghana is often scattered across multiple reports and datasets. 
<p></p>
This makes it difficult to gain a complete and unified view of national trends. To address this gap, this study brings together five key datasets to analyze HIV prevalence, demographic patterns, regional distribution, and AIDS-related deaths. By combining these datasets, the analysis provides clearer insights that can support more informed decision-making and targeted interventions.

## DATA USED
This analysis is based on five key datasets that collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of HIV patterns, trends, and demographic impacts in Ghana. Each dataset contributes unique information that enhances the depth and accuracy of the findings.

<p></p>
<b>1. HIV Prevalence by Age Group Dataset:</b>
This dataset shows the proportion of HIV-positive individuals within each age group relative to the number tested. It supports the calculation of prevalence rates and helps identify age groups with higher vulnerability. This information is important for designing age-specific prevention and counselling programs.

<p></p> 
<b>2. HIV Gender Estimates Dataset:</b>
This dataset breaks down HIV-positive cases by male and female populations. It is useful for examining gender disparities, understanding which groups are more affected, and supporting targeted public health responses. The data helps measure progress in reducing gender-based infection gaps.

<p></p>
<b>3. HIV Positive by Age Group & Site Dataset:</b>
This dataset captures HIV cases categorized by different age groups and testing sites. It provides insight into which age ranges carry the highest infection burden. The dataset also helps identify site-specific variations that may affect surveillance, prevention, and testing strategies.

<p></p>
<b>4. AIDS Related Deaths Dataset:</b>
This dataset contains annual records of AIDS-related deaths across the regions of Ghana. It helps assess the mortality burden associated with HIV and evaluates how deaths have changed over time. The data is essential for understanding the severity of the epidemic and identifying regions that require enhanced treatment and support services.

<p></p>
<b>5. Ghana HIV Map (2004–2014):</b>
This dataset provides geographically referenced HIV-positive cases across Ghana’s regions, including coordinates such as latitude and longitude. It supports spatial analysis and the creation of map visuals that illustrate regional variations in HIV infections. It helps highlight geographic hotspots and spread patterns over the 10-year period.

## OBJECTIVES
1. Determine the prevalence of HIV across different regions of Ghana from 2004 to 2014.
2. Analyze trends over the years to identify whether HIV prevalence is increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable.
3. Assess the distribution by age groups and gender to identify high-risk populations.
4. Compare regional differences to highlight areas with the highest and lowest prevalence.
5. Provide insights for public health interventions based on observed patterns and trends.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
<b>Tools Used: Excel, Power Bi,</b>
<p></p>
<b>Data cleaning involved:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Removing empty or duplicate rows</li>
  <li>Correcting inconsistent region names</li>
  <li>Ensuring uniform year formats</li>
  <li>Formatting numeric fields (percentages, totals, prevalence rates)</li>
  <li>Mapping regional capitals with accurate latitude and longitude values</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<b>Data Modeling</b>                                                    
<b>Tool Used: Power BI </b>
<p>Relationships were created in Power BI to connect datasets logically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Region ↔ HIV Map Data</li>
  <li>Region ↔ Prevalence Data</li>
  <li>Region ↔ AIDS-Related Deaths</li>
  <li>Year ↔ HIV Positive / Gender Data</li>
</ul>
