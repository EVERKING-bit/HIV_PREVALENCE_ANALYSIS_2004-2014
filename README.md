# 📊 Ghana HIV Data Analysis (2004–2014)
Comprehensive Regional, Gender, Age, Site, and Mortality Insights
This project presents an in-depth analysis of HIV trends in Ghana using five major datasets covering prevalence, gender distribution, regional distribution, age patterns, site-level data, and AIDS-related deaths.
All analyses were visualized through multi-dashboard Power BI reports.

## INTRODUCTION
HIV remains one of the most significant public health challenges in Ghana, affecting individuals, families, and entire communities across the country. Understanding the prevalence and distribution of HIV is essential for guiding national health policies, allocating resources, and implementing targeted interventions.
<p></p>
By analyzing trends across regions, age groups, and years, stakeholders can identify high-risk areas, monitor progress toward national health goals, and strengthen prevention and treatment strategies. This analysis provides valuable insights into how HIV cases are evolving over time, helping health authorities, researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions that support a healthier and more resilient nation.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
HIV continues to pose a significant public health challenge in Ghana, affecting individuals, families, and communities across all regions. Despite ongoing interventions, variations in prevalence still exist between regions, age groups, and genders, making it necessary to conduct detailed and data-driven assessments. Understanding these patterns is essential for guiding national strategies, improving resource allocation, and strengthening prevention and treatment programs.
However, existing HIV-related data in Ghana is often scattered across multiple reports and datasets. 
<p></p>
This makes it difficult to gain a complete and unified view of national trends. To address this gap, this study brings together five key datasets to analyze HIV prevalence, demographic patterns, regional distribution, and AIDS-related deaths. By combining these datasets, the analysis provides clearer insights that can support more informed decision-making and targeted interventions.

## DATA USED
This analysis is based on five key datasets that collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of HIV patterns, trends, and demographic impacts in Ghana. Each dataset contributes unique information that enhances the depth and accuracy of the findings.

<b>1. HIV Prevalence by Age Group Dataset:</b>
This dataset shows the proportion of HIV-positive individuals within each age group relative to the number tested. It supports the calculation of prevalence rates and helps identify age groups with higher vulnerability. This information is important for designing age-specific prevention and counselling programs.

<b>2. HIV Gender Estimates Dataset:</b>
This dataset breaks down HIV-positive cases by male and female populations. It is useful for examining gender disparities, understanding which groups are more affected, and supporting targeted public health responses. The data helps measure progress in reducing gender-based infection gaps.

🧠 Key Insights & Findings (Summary)
Greater Accra and Ashanti consistently show the highest HIV cases, indicating major urban hotspots.

Females recorded significantly higher HIV cases than males across all regions.

Ages 25–39 show the highest HIV prevalence, reflecting increased risk among young adults.

AIDS-related deaths decreased steadily from 2004 to 2014, showing improvements in treatment and ART access.

Rural sites reported cases but urban sites accounted for higher positivity, likely due to testing access differences.

Northern and Upper regions show lower HIV cases, but still require targeted prevention due to rising trends.

📝 Summary With Recommendations
The overall analysis indicates a concentrated HIV burden in urbanized regions, especially Greater Accra and Ashanti. The gender pattern highlights a persistent higher vulnerability among females, requiring strengthened empowerment, early detection, and tailored interventions. The 25–39 age group remains a critical risk segment due to socio-economic and behavioral factors. Despite increasing HIV cases across regions, the decline in AIDS-related deaths reflects progress in treatment availability.

Recommendations
Strengthen urban-focused prevention in Greater Accra & Ashanti

Expand female-focused HIV education, testing, and support programs

Intensify HIV testing among youth (15–24) to reduce late detection

Improve rural testing infrastructure to capture underreported areas

Continue expanding ART coverage to sustain reduction in deaths

Increase public awareness and stigma reduction campaigns

🏁 Conclusion
The analysis clearly shows that Ghana has made progress in reducing AIDS-related deaths, but HIV transmission remains active, particularly in highly populated regions and among adults aged 25–39. Gender disparities and regional differences emphasize the need for targeted, data-driven interventions. Strengthening prevention, improving access to testing, and sustaining treatment programs are vital to reducing new infections and improving national HIV outcomes.
